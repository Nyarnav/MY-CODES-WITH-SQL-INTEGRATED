Hi my name is Van Ryan Nahine, im currently grade 12 ICT/CSS right now.

Im using git at termux, and im trying my best to be familiar with it.

i want to share my small projects in here and people might want to test it out.

other people can also use the code too.

I'm also a self taught programmer, im currently advance studying to compete in the tech industry, and im eager to learn more about technologies and programming stuff.
