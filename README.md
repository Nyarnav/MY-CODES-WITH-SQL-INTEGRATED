Hi my name is Van Ryan Nahine, im currently grade 12 ICT/CSS right now.

I'm trying to familiarize github and i would love to try git too, sadly im only using my phone to code.

i want to share my small projects in here and people might want to test it out.

other people can also use the code too.

I'm also a self taught programmer, im currently advance studying to compete in the tech industry, and im eager to learn more about technologies and programming stuff.
